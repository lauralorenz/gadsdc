Memes
=====
and the principle of virality
---

The term "meme" was first coined in 1989 by Richard Dawkins in his book _The Selfish Gene_, and refers to information that spreads among a population, often changing and evolving much like genes do. Memes can be text, images, sounds, videos, or other media that spread widely enough to be in the collective consciousness of a culture. The term "meme" can be applied to any environment, but is commonly associated with the Internet.

On January 8, 2014, the Facebook Data Science team [posted their research describing the evolution of Facebook memes](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-science/the-evolution-of-memes-on-facebook/10151988334203859?notif_t=notify_me) on their Facebook page. By using the [Yule process](http://math.uchicago.edu/~shmuel/Network-course-readings/Yule.pdf) to predict a meme's [Gini coefficient](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10888-011-9188-x#page-1), Facebook connected the mutation rate and popularity index of 876 Facebook memes. 

Furthermore, by studying common mutations in a given meme, Facebook identified specific aspects of memes that contributed to their fitness, such as employing competitive cues ("see how many people X") or closeness to correct grammar and spelling, and measured the popularity of a meme in the context of its political environment.
