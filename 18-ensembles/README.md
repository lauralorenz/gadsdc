### Before

Read this collection on the [Top 10 algorithms in data mining](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/10Algorithms-08.pdf). It includes some things we've seen before, some that we haven't spent time on, and some material on ensembles.

Optional:

 * Read [A few useful things to know about machine learning](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf) for the second time. It should be pretty familiar material by now!


### Questions

 * What other thoughts, comments, concerns, and questions do you have? What's on your mind?
