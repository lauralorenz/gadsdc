### Before

Optional:


### Questions

 * Consider thinking of boolean multinomial Naive Bayes likelihood probabilities as coefficients on word dummy features. How are they similar or different as compared with logistic regression coefficients?
 * What other thoughts, comments, concerns, and questions do you have? What's on your mind?


### During

Application presentation.

Question review.

Likely use the Social Web book appendix C, though it has some issues - missing bit on UTF-8, etc.
