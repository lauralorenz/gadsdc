### Before

 * Read [Choosing a Machine Learning Classifier](http://blog.echen.me/2011/04/27/choosing-a-machine-learning-classifier/).
 * Read this [post](http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/random-forests-in-python.html) on random forests in Python.

Optional:

 * Read [Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~jtian/cs573/Papers/Dietterich-ensemble-00.pdf).
 * Read [A few useful things to know about machine learning](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf) for the second time. It should be pretty familiar material by now!


### Questions

 * What other thoughts, comments, concerns, and questions do you have? What's on your mind?


### During

Application presentation.

Question review.


### After

Optional:

 * Read through the `sklearn` [documentation on ensemble methods](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/ensemble.html).
 * Check out Jay Hyer's excellent slides on [Ensemble Methods](http://adataheadsdiary.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/dsdc-ensemble-learing.pdf).
 * Check out kaggle's [Getting Started With Random Forests](http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/details/getting-started-with-random-forests).
 * You might look into this [post](http://citizennet.com/blog/2012/11/10/random-forests-ensembles-and-performance-metrics/) about neural nets and random forests, oh my.
