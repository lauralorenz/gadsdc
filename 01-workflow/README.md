### Before

Optional:

* Read this paper: "[Amplifying the Voice of Youth in Africa via Text Analytics](http://www.prem-melville.com/publications/unicef-kdd2013.pdf)" (It was one of the best from [KDD](http://www.kdd.org/) 2013.) You don't have to follow everything in the paper; it gives a nice overview of a complete "data science" process, including data architecture, modeling, evaluation, and application.


### Questions

 * Where are you in Conway's [data science Venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram)? What related skills and training do you have? What fields/topics do you know? What are you interested in learning more about?


### During

(Work from slides.)

Email instructors.

An example of an analysis using version control data
 * "Collaboration in the open-source arena: The WebKit case" [[arXiv]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5996) [[PDF]](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.5996v1.pdf) [[more]](http://users.utu.fi/joante/WebKitSNA/)

[Application Presentations](../application_presentations) assigned and scheduled.

(End work from slides.)

Setting up a machine on [AWS EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and getting set up with [git](http://git-scm.com/) and [github](https://github.com/). These blog posts describe much of the process demonstrated in class:

 * [Easy AWS EC2 Ubuntu Quick Start](http://planspace.org/2014/01/25/easy-aws-ec2-ubuntu-quick-start/)
 * [A shared playground on Ubuntu](http://planspace.org/2014/02/15/a-shared-playground-on-ubuntu/)
 * [Set up git/hub on Ubuntu](http://planspace.org/2014/02/16/set-up-github-on-ubuntu/)

Please never put spaces in filenames.

Please always end files with a newline.

You should know these: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `hostname`, `whoami`, `passwd`, `ssh`, `env`, `export`.

On Ubuntu, `apt-get install` things you want.

Learn some `readline`/`emacs` [keyboard navigation shortcuts](http://www.catonmat.net/download/readline-emacs-editing-mode-cheat-sheet.pdf).

You should know at least one command-line text editor. When in doubt, you can usually fall back on `nano`. In some cases `vi` is the only thing available, so at least know how to get out by hitting `esc` and then entering `q!`. People generally develop proficiency in at least one of `vim` or `emacs`. There's nothing wrong with using a GUI editor such as [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/), [TextMate](http://macromates.com/), or [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) as well.

For `git`: `git init`, `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git clone`, `git pull`, `git log`, etc.

On github, be able to fork and submit pull requests.

More command-line tools: `man`, `time`, `wget`, `curl`, [`tmux`](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course), `echo`, `cat`, `diff`, `tr`, `sort`, `wc`, `more`, `less`, `head`, `tail`, `cut`, `uniq`, `join`, `grep`, `bc`.

[Command-Line Data Manipulation](http://planspace.org/2013/05/21/command-line-data-manipulation/)

Just enough `sed` and regular expressions to know what they are:

    cat file.txt | sed 's/^/ * /'

You'll need to know some [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and [github-flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) is often handy too. This [live markdown editor](http://jrmoran.com/playground/markdown-live-editor/) can be useful.

Play with git logs to do a simple analysis of open source projects. (Perhaps choose some that are [trending](https://github.com/trending).)

### Questions

 * How do you feel about today's class? Do you think you'll be able to start using some of the tools we covered? Would you like further support, in office hours or otherwise?
 * What ideas or thoughts do you have about your class project? Have you started thinking about it yet?
 * What other thoughts, comments, concerns, and questions do you have? What's on your mind?


### After

 * If you don't have them already, make a [twitter](https://twitter.com/) account and a [blog](http://sixrevisions.com/tools/top-free-online-blogging/). Communication is a good thing!
 * In your fork of the class repository, in the `01-workflow` directory, make a file named `yourname.md` containing links to your twitter account and blog. Commit, push to github, and submit a pull request to get your file in the class repository.

Optional:
 * Make your own EC2 micro Ubuntu instance and set it up a little.
 * Try out [csvkit](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/), which makes data at the command line a lot more fun!
 * Do the `emacs` tutorial. (In `emacs`, press `control` and `h`, then press `t`.)
 * Learn the `vim` editor with its tutorial, or perhaps with [a fun game](http://vim-adventures.com/)!
 * Learn more about `sed` and `awk`.
 * Read this chapter from the Bad Data Handbook: "Myths of cloud computing"
 * To get into _a lot_ more at the command line, check out the fine [presentation](http://files.meetup.com/1406240/Command%20Line%20Data%20Science.pdf) from Jeroen Janssens. See also his [blog post](http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/09/19/seven-command-line-tools-for-data-science.html) on some of the same tools.
