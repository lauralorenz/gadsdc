# Installing Hadoop

Installing Hadoop can be an arduous process as it requires a lot of setup and configuration.  To workaround these we will be using the Cloudera VM Sandbox install, which is virtual machine that has all of the necessary software installed.

##Virtual Box
First we need to install Virtual Box, a free VM software:

https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Please download and install the appropriate version

##Download Cloudera Sandbox

Next we would like to download Sandbox.  This is available at http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera-content/cloudera-docs/DemoVMs/Cloudera-QuickStart-VM/cloudera_quickstart_vm.html

Please download VM for VirtualBox.

## Alternatives

You can attempt to install Hadoop locally to your own machine.  If you have Homebrew, it will make it much easier but there is still a fair amount of configuration.  

Here is a good walkthrough using brew: [http://blog.tundramonkey.com/2013/02/24/setting-up-hadoop-on-osx-mountain-lion](http://blog.tundramonkey.com/2013/02/24/setting-up-hadoop-on-osx-mountain-lion)
